# Totally Generic Shoot-em-up!

Here are some thoughts off the top of my head, based on zero research
whatsoever except the gaming experience of a person who wasn't even really
all that into shoot-em-ups growing up, and never considered themselves to
be particularly good at them.

You might ask "why would such a person bother making a shoot-em-up??"

The answer is:

a) I've really enjoyed playing a few of them (mostly on my phone) over the
past year or so, and this has caused me to think back more fondly on those
I played as a kid.

b) They are pretty formulaic, but still fun when done right. What's
involved in doing one "right", or making it fun?? Let's try to find out.
Without doing any *actual* research, of course.


## Things a shoot-em-up has to have:

* A player ship

* Enemies

* Some kind of score

Now that I've said they are essential, are there any examples of
shoot-em-ups that don't have these? "Score" can be defined in lots of
different ways, of course, but can you have a shoot-em-up without either
enemies or a central player character of some kind?

## Things a shoot-em-up might have:

* Powerups!

* Levels (whether waves, terrain variation, etc)

* Boss Battles

* A story (told via inter-level stages, level intros, etc)

A shoot-em-up could have *anything*, of course, but these items are common
elements that aren't actually essential.

## Some basic design principles for a shoot-em-up:

### Progressive Difficulty

This sounds pretty obvious, but the game has to get more difficult over time, while the player is possibly becoming more powerful. This will usually involve stronger, faster and/or more powerful enemies, perhaps faced in greater numbers.

### Skill matters more than chance 

There may be elements of chance (although in many shmups this is not the case) but skill must play a bigger part than luck; if two players face the same battle, the more skillful player should generally be expected to do better (whether by getting a higher score, surviving for longer, or so on).

Death comes because the player made a wrong choice, or was finally overwhelmed - not purely by chance.

### Overwhelming odds

You face a ridiculous, completely unrealistic number of enemies. Sometimes they fire an absurd number of bullets. You will die many, many times. It's not meant to be easy!

### Predictable enemies

It's not meant to be easy, but there *are* patterns to be learned.  In many games you can actually memorise the order, position and behaviour of every enemy. Improvement comes as you learn and begin to anticipate the behaviour of the enemy.

This is a *feature*, not a bug. Because you will die so often, replayability comes through feeling a sense of progress; sure, you died again, but this time you got further than before. Sometimes you will manage to enter some kind of zen-like state, where you are no longer even consciously thinking about how to play the game but just doing so automatically.
